# Abstract

Food is nothing less than an essential part of life and a major global economic force. Different cuisines use different ingredients and sometimes certain pairs of ingredients have really high frequency in worldwide recipes. We want to explore the traditional pairings we know, while also revealing non-traditional and surprising combinations in different cuisines through our analysis. 

In this project, we define ‘key ingredient’ as the most commonly used ingredient. We investigate on popularity of recipes and ingredients to know more food characteristics. These characteristics are not only interesting, but they also provide us with a new perspective on food patterns which is closely related to public health, revealing the possible relationship between food ingredients and public health data.

Mainly we are going to use these data sets: `cooking recipe` and `Global Health Observatory data repository`. We can obtain recipe ingredients, countries and regional health data from these data sets and our analysis will be based on them.

# Research questions

* What are the most popular recipes? Do popular cuisines have special preference on ingredients or preparation time?

* What are the key ingredients for different cuisines and recipes? 

* Does ingredient-based relationship (similarity or dissimilarity) exist between various regional cuisines? If it does, could it be geographical, climatic or cultural? 

* Can we find a relationship between regional ingredients and public health data?


# Dataset

In this project, we decide to use `cooking recipes` as our main dataset, and we will also combine the data from `Global Health Observatory data repository`. 

Cooking recipe: 2.53 GB of zipped data and concludes more than 93,000 html web pages on recipes. From each web page we infer information which includes the name of the dish, preparation time, the ingredients, directions for preparation and nutritional facts. Also, we notice the number of reviews differ between recipes, and we think we can use the number of reviews as a proof for popularity.

Global Health Observatory data repository from WHO: The global health observatory data repository is very comprehensive and it includes data sets on various perspectives, including statistics from all countries on non communicable disease (NCD), prevalence of obesity, raised blood pressure and raised cholesterol etc. These data sets can be downloaded in .csv format or json format.

Through combining the information from these datasets, we can obtain ingredients, culinary techniques, nutritional facts, popularity and geographical distribution of cuisines worldwide. And with the dataset from WHO, we can even go further to analyze the possible relationship between recipes and public health.

# Result

In this project, we achieved:

1. Scraped 86607 recipes from allrecipes, food, foodnetwork and yummly, and created csv files with useful information (including title of dishes, nutritions, ingredients, cooking time, cuisine type etc.). Cleaning data(especially the ingredients) using NLP.
2. Find out the most popular recipes and ingredients for each cuisines.
3. Find connections between cuisines by their shared ingredients, using Jaccard similarity, networkx and t-SNE.
4. Find out regional features for cuisines and connect cuisine nutritients with public health data.
5. Show the cooking time difference in each cuisine.


# The structure of repo

Master Branch
1. Input data: .csv files used for data analysis.
2. Scripts: allrecipes_parsing.py, food_parsing.py, foodnetwork_parsing.py, move_webpages_to_folders.py, yummly_parsing.py, scripts used for webscraping and visualization.
3. FINALNOTEBOOK.ipynb: The final notebook for this project.
